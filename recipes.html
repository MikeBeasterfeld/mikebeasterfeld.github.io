                    <p>We started making our own dog food for our pets in 2023.  We feel like they are healthier and happier with the change.  This is a pretty common recipe with a few changes we made to fit their needs.</p>

                        <ul class="list-group list-group-numbered">
                            <li class="list-group-item">Start prepping your vegetables, most of which we buy frozen. Each bag takes 5 minutes in the microwave so you want these to be cooking while you work through the other steps.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">Start browning the ground meat on medium heat.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">As the meat starts to finish, we add our eggs to the same pot. We have heard that you can blend up the eggshells and add them back in for extra calcium but we have not tried it yet.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">When the eggs are cooked through, add the 1 cup of rice and the 2 cups of water.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">Add the vegetables and beans.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">At this point we are just waiting for the rice to cook which can take 30 minutes to an hour. Put the burner on high until there is a slight boil then turn the head down to low.  You could cook the rice separate in a rice cooker and it might be faster.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                Our smaller dogs (less than 5 pounds) get about 75 grams two times per day.

                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                Our 15 pound dog gets 150 grams two times per day.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">We will sometimes also add fruits from our fridge that are close to going bad such as blueberries, strawberries, or pineapple.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">We also sometimes add some sort of whole canned fish like sardines for some omega 3 oils.</li>
